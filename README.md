# Content design and user research meetup – ConCon 10
Resources from the content design and user research meetup at ConCon 10 – the cross-government content conference – on 19 May 2021</a>. Including slides, links and contact details.

## Notes from the interactive parts

We used Mentimeter and Teams to run the session. Mentimeter lets you ask questions, do polls and get feedback from the audience. During each lightning talk, we asked for people’s thoughts and ideas, then spent 5 minutes discussing them after each talk. We also used Mentimeter for a retro at the end.

### Dan Howarth: can we talk about hypotheses?

### Ariana Mihoc: card sorting

Ariana is a senior user researcher at the Central Digital & Data Office, part of the UK government. Her talk was on card sorting, a powerful user research technique for creating taxonomies. Ariana did a similar session for the cross-government content community in March, which was recorded. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRarxgcIIqw">You can see the recording on YouTube</a>.

## How to analyse a card sort

Following her lightning talk on card sorting, Ariana showed us how to analyse a card sort activity, using Optimal Workshop. We’re not going to post the outputs here. But we are thinking about how to summarise it, and we’ll update this page when we do.
